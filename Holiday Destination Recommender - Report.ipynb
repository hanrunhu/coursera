This step would not be necessary if potential destination cities are only compared to one single benchmark city; in that case, manual clustering into e.g. \"similar\" or \"non-similar\" destination cities would be easily possible. However, since the Holiday Destination Recommender is supposed to work with multiple benchmark cities, manually identifying the right number of clusters and correctly assigning a large amount of destination cities to the right cluster is inefficient.
